# CartPole DQN 🎮

An implementation of **Deep Q‑Network (DQN)** to solve the classic **CartPole‑v1** environment from [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).  
Built with **PyTorch**, this project demonstrates reinforcement learning fundamentals: replay buffer, epsilon‑greedy exploration, target network updates, and training loop.

## 🚀 Features
- DQN agent implemented in PyTorch
- Experience Replay Buffer
- Epsilon‑greedy exploration strategy
- Target network with soft/hard updates
- Training loop with reward tracking
- Evaluation script with video recording of the trained agent
